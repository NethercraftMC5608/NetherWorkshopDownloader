**Will work for a majority of games on steam, some games might not work. (anonymous account)**
__if having problems downloading collections or mods, make sure any file/cmd from the workshop downloader is closed, otherwise it will not function.__

**Made this workshop downloader as I just heard that Steam is taking all the steam downloaders down. And also all of them are broken.**
**Made with SteamCMD**

**I have lost the source code for NetherWorkshopDownloader1 so i am unable to provide a open release but a compiled close release. Sorry! but most important stuff is still in the file. And will not be maintained or updated.**

**Enjoy!**

**PLEASE UPLOAD BUGS OR PROBLEMS IN THE ISSUES TAB, NOT ANYWHERE ELSE. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU, THANKS!**

writing is alittle scuffed, as this program was only for personal use. But it works!
