## üîí Whats different about Nether Workshop Downloader than other downloaders?

While other downloaders only download anonymous mods, and have private accounts locked in a paywall. Nether Workshop Downloader is a community driven project that allows you to download any workshop mod on steam whether its anonymous or non anonymous.
NetherSpider API carrys a database full of accounts scraped from public account websites, using a custom steam web login handler and proxies to allow to login to hundreds of accounts and fetch app ids in seconds. This allows to create a database full of working steam accounts, in which can be used for downloading steam workshop mods free and effortlessly.

## How many games are there?
Games will be forever increasing and to be working with the increasing amount of accounts with custom scrapers made by me take accounts from public sites by the second, however some games may be not working due to no working login credentials.
Please be patient :)

## Is this free?
Absolutely free, you don't need to pay anything for it at all. However donations would be helpful in funding proxies used to fetch accounts. But im doing this only for the convenience of you and myself.

## Will the app get better?

Of course, it is just basic now to get it out to you. In the upcoming updates, i will have more ui changes than API changes, all that matters is to have a **reliable** experience in using NetherWorkshopDownloader.

## Why is the API and client propietary?

The program obviously is a crawler, and no website owner likes crawling. So it would be kept secret for no patching. And in order to protect the accounts. However you can use it for free until it lasts.
## Does it download collections?
Yes you can download collections.

NWD5 takes advantage of steamctl, a custom handler would be built to have multiple downloads.

## üï∑Ô∏è How It Works

Our proprietary **NetherSpider** crawler scours "Steam game sharing" websites to find public accounts with access to your desired games. Here‚Äôs the process:

1. **Search**: Enter a mod in Nether Steam Workshop Downloader.
2. **Fetch**: NetherSpider gives you a account if game is working
3. **Download**: Download **Locally** and safely through a custom steam handler, which protects your infomation.
4. **Enjoy**: :)
