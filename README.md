**Still Works! 20/09/2022**
**Will work for a majority of games on steam, some games might not work. (anonymous account)**
__if having problems downloading collections or mods, make sure any file/cmd from the workshop downloader is closed, otherwise it will not function.__

**Made this workshop downloader as I just heard that Steam is taking all the steam downloaders down. And also all of them are broken.**
**Made with SteamCMD**

__Disclaimer! This could be seen as a "virus" by your computer. It uses administrator and permits your PC to run PowerShell scripts. Powershell is used by the script. if your paranoia is extreme.

**I have lost the source code for this project so i am unable to provide a open release but a compiled close release. Sorry! but most important stuff is still in the file. And will not be maintained or updated.**

**Enjoy!**
